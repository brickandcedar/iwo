# Valentine's Day Interactive Page

A fun, interactive Valentine's Day page where the "Yes" button grows bigger every time they click "No" — with falling hearts, cute GIFs, music, and playful toast messages. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Live demo:** [brickandcedar.github.io/iwo](https://brickandcedar.github.io/iwo)

## How It Works

- **Click "No"** and watch the Yes button grow bigger with each click
- The No button changes text with guilt-trip messages
- The cute character GIF changes through different emotional stages
- After 5 No clicks, the No button runs away from your cursor
- **Click "Yes"** (after the No button runs away) to see confetti and a celebration message
- Toggle music with the 🔊 button in the bottom-right corner
